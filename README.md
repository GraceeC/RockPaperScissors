# RockPaperScissors



## Technique
Creating this application has helped me have a better understanding of JavaScript. Such as nesting a function inside one another, giving 
value to an undefined variable through parameters. Also learning to debug my application to find the type of element to give value to give some sort of behavior.
This Rock Paper Scissors has helped with my vocabulary terminology. There for I am able to find a way to solve the issue i'm currently working on at the current moment. It has been a trial an error domino effect which I have started to feel confident about my process in software development. I hope you enjoy this application and have a wonderful playing!
