## Technique
Creating this application has helped my understand of JavaScript such as nesting a function inside another, giving 
value to an undefined varible and finding the typeof an element to be able to debug to complete this application. 
This Rock Paper Scissors has helped improved my coding vocabulary as I feel more confident then I did before I began this application.
