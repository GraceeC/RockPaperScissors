# Technique
Creating this application has helped me learn the fundamentals of JavaScript. Nesting functions inside one another, giving 
value to an undefined variable by using parameters. As well to debug my code to find the type of element to give value to give a type of behavior.
This application has helped expand my coding terminology. There for I am able to find a way to solve the issue i'm currently working on at the current moment. It has been a trial an error which felt like a domino effect. I have started to feel confident about my process in software development. I hope you enjoy this application as much as I did creating it!
